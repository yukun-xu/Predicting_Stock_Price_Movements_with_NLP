This project applies Machine Learning techniques such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis on news data to predict the stock price movements.
We divide this project into the following three steps. The first step involves collecting news data from Google News website using web scraping, and the historical stock prices of S&P 500 companies from Yahoo! Finance. The second step is to clean the news data and transform unstructured text data into numerical features using NLP techniques. In this step, we also define the labels we are trying to classify. In the third step, we split data into into training, validation and testing and feed them into classification models. With this whole process, we use a feedback mechanism to update our feature engineering methods and model selection continually.
